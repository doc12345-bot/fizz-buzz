- This site will have two large buttons, labelled Fizz and Buzz. In the centre there will be a console showing a starting number. Below the button the user can also input a number of their choosing. If the number after the number in the console is a multiple of 3 the user should push the Fizz, a multiple of 5 the Buzz button and anything else enter it in the box beneath. If the correct sequence is followed the number changes and the game continues. If the user chooses the wrong option an alert will appear telling them the correct choice.
